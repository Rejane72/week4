
The run_analysis.R script preparation and clean the original data only with mean of all mean and standerd deviation variables from the original data.


Download the dataset
Dataset was downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

Assign each data to variables
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns

activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns

List of activities (and labels) performed by participants 

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column

x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns

y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column

x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns

y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns



Description of merged data: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function


Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
extract_data1 - contain 10299 rows and 88 columns


Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
The column named "code" was replaced with corresponding activity 


Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

- code variable was replaced by activities
- all punc and space were eliminated
- mean and std were replaced by " (mean) " and " (std) "


Final database contain (180 rows, 88 columns) and was exported to text file: FinalData.txt
